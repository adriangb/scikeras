The aim is to keep 99% of the flexibility of `Keras` while being able to leverage most features of `sklearn`. Below, we show the basic usage of `SciKeras` and how it can be combined with `sklearn`.\n",

We must also pass all of the arguments to `get_clf` as keyword arguments to `KerasClassifier` if they don't have a default value in `get_clf`.

The differences include using `KerasRegressor` instead of `KerasClassifier` and adding `keras.metrics.R2Score` as a metric. Most of the Scikit-learn regressors use the coefficient of determination or R^2 as a metric function, which measures correlation between the true labels and predicted labels."
