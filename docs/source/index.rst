Welcome to SciKeras's documentation!
====================================

The goal of scikeras is to make it possible to use Keras/TensorFlow with sklearn. 
This is achieved by providing a wrapper around Keras that has an Scikit-Learn interface.
SciKeras is the successor to ``keras.wrappers.scikit_learn``, and offers many
improvements over the TensorFlow version of the wrappers. See :ref:`Migration<Migration>` for a more details.

SciKeras tries to make things easy for you while staying out of your way.
If you are familiar with Scikit-Learn and Keras, you don’t have to learn any new concepts, and the syntax should be well known.

Overall, SciKeras aims at being as flexible as Keras while having a clean interface as Scikit-Learn.
